# Repeaters

Repeaters are one of the coolest features of the plugin! You can place a repeater pylon where you want and set a custom range and speed for it.

You can get one with the following command:

> `/phone repeater <speed> <range> <career>`

After placing one, phones will start working under the following criteria:

* The range specifies how many blocks the connection lasts.
* The speed specifies how much delay is put in the connection.
* The career matches to the ones specified on the config.
* Only users with that career can use the repeater.
* If you are far from the repeater the connection will be slower.
* More high the speed is, more slow the connection will be.
