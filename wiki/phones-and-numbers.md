# Phones & Numbers

You can get a phone with the `/phone <give> <player>` command but you wonâ€™t be able to do much with just it, read more below.

## Numbers

Each player can have a phone number, you can see your one with `/phone number <player>` or see the owner of a number with `/phone whois <number>.`

You can generate a new number with `/phone regen <player>`.

## Subscriptions

You can create a subscription and let your users pay in game currencies to renew it. You can use the following command to renew or create a new subscription:

> `/phone renew <player> <carrier>`
