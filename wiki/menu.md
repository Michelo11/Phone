# Menu

The phone menu is pretty intuitive, you can use the page items to change page, add contact to create a new one and accept and deny/close buttons to manage calls.

The contact item has different actions that you can run with:

* Left click: Send a message
* Right click: Start a call
* Drop: Delete the contact
