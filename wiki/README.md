# Getting Started

## Installing the plugin

Installing the plugin is simple and doesnâ€™t require extra configuration. Drop the jar in the plugins folder and restart your server to load it.

## Database

The plugin requires a database to save the data, you can choose between SQLite and MySQL. By default the plugin uses SQLite since it can store data efficiently without extra configuration.

If you want to use MySQL you can specify it in the `type` option and then setup all the credentials.
