- Place the JAR file into your server's plugins directory.
  
- Restart your server to load the plugin.
  
- Refer to the plugin's config.yml file for customizable messages.

- Get your first phone with /phone give command.

## Features

- Phone Item: Get a phone item, click on it and manage your contacts from a gui.

- Contacts Menu: Save contacts of your friends to quickly call them or just drop a message.

- Share Number: Share your phone number just by right clicking on the target player.

- Subscriptions: Create a subscription and limit user messages per month and let them renew their monthly amount.

- Repeaters: Make sure to stay near a repeater pylon with an amazing texture to make a call or send a message.
